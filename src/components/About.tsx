      <p>
        I am a developer focused on simplicity and elegance in software design.
        I believe that the best solutions are not just functional, but also
        intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am exploring the intersection of design systems and modern
        web technologies to build more resilient and performant applications.
